Hello, i'am a junior front-end developer, familiar with JavaScript, HTML/CSS and design tools to deliver an exceptional customer experience with an artistic eye. I integrate websites, web apps, and landing pages from concept to deployment, and standardize all results with a fresh approach and strategy to responsive and mobile UX and UI design for technical feasibility. All of this is executed through close collaboration with team members to implement new feature development.
